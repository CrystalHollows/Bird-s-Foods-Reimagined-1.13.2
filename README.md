Liscense: 
MIT Liscense/(My Custom-ish Liscense): 
You CAN make addons for this mod, make videos about this mod, put this mod in your modpack, edit this mod to work with your modpack (example: changed recipe), etc. 
You SHOULD tell me! I'd love to see what this mod is being used for! 
You CAN NOT reupload the mod/use this mod in any way for commercial use. 
Reuploading the mod is like 9minecraft.com. They can make a page about the mod, but they have to link the download to my CurseForge download. Commercial use, of course, is like selling something from the mod. I want this to be a 100% FREE mod! 

How To Reach Me: 
Finally, if you have any suggestions for the mod make sure to let me know on Curse/Discord (CrystalHollows#5386)!
